#' Example Dataset
#'
#' This is some example data created using rpois and sample.  It can be used to run the functions in RegCombinPack
#'
#' The variables included in the dataset are:
#' \itemize{
#' \item\code{Y} A vector of 15 numbers sampled from 1:100 without replacement.
#' \item\code{Variable 1} A vector of numbers drawn from a Poisson distribution with lambda=26.
#' \item\code{Variable 2} A vector of numbers drawn from a Poisson distribution with lambda=26.
#' \item\code{Variable 3} A vector of numbers drawn from a Poisson distribution with lambda=26.
#' \item\code{Variable 4} A vector of numbers drawn from a Poisson distribution with lambda=26.
